# Busconnect
The idea for this web app is to tell you if the bus route you want to catch will line up with your train on arrival. This is possible with the official PTV mobile app, however it is difficult and time consuming to do.

At the moment it just uses a front end so can be run without a web server.

This app relies on the PTV API, documented here http://timetableapi.ptv.vic.gov.au/swagger/ui/index
Before you can start using the PTV you will need to register for an API key, which can be done here https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/about-ptv/ptv-data-and-reports/digital-products/ptv-timetable-api/
